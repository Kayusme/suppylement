Notice
------
This program was created simply as an exercise in working with a slightly
larger Python project than I have before. Working with data, reading/writing
files, testing, that sort of thing. Kratom is intended strictly for botanical
purposes only. Not for human consumption. We cannot condone or encourage any
personal use or consumption of kratom.
